# payment-providers Specification

## Purpose
Defines the payment provider contract: how the store distinguishes online
(gateway-backed) from offline (manual) payments, how payment addons register
themselves, what REST surface each kind is served on, where offline providers
are persisted, and how a placed order records which provider took the payment.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Payment providers are classified as online or offline

The system SHALL model every way of taking payment as a payment provider, and
SHALL classify each provider as either **online** (payment is captured through
an external gateway) or **offline** (payment is arranged manually outside the
store, such as cash on delivery or bank transfer).

The classification SHALL be exposed on every payment payload as the boolean
field `is_offline`, where `true` means offline and `false` means online. The
field name `is_manual` SHALL NOT appear in any payment payload.

#### Scenario: Reading an online provider

- **WHEN** a client reads a provider served from the online payments endpoints
- **THEN** the payload includes `is_offline` with the value `false`
- **AND** the payload does not include a field named `is_manual`

#### Scenario: Reading an offline provider

- **WHEN** a client reads a provider served from the offline payments endpoints
- **THEN** the payload includes `is_offline` with the value `true`

#### Scenario: Order-level manual flag is unaffected

- **WHEN** a client reads an order that was created by an administrator
- **THEN** the order still reports its own `is_manual` field, which denotes an
  admin-created order and is unrelated to provider classification

### Requirement: Payment addons register through a single provider hook

The system SHALL expose one extension point through which a plugin can
contribute additional payment providers: the WordPress filter
`kirki_ecommerce_payment_providers`. A contributed provider SHALL be an
instance of the payment provider base type, and SHALL be registered under the
provider id it reports.

The filter name `kirki_ecommerce_all_payment_gateways` SHALL NOT be honored.

#### Scenario: An addon contributes a provider

- **WHEN** an active plugin appends a payment provider instance to the
  `kirki_ecommerce_payment_providers` filter
- **THEN** that provider is present in the store's provider registry and is
  resolvable by its id

#### Scenario: An addon uses the retired hook name

- **WHEN** a plugin appends a provider to `kirki_ecommerce_all_payment_gateways`
- **THEN** that provider is not registered, because the retired filter is no
  longer applied

#### Scenario: Bundled providers are registered without an addon

- **WHEN** the store boots with no payment addon plugins active
- **THEN** the bundled PayPal provider and every configured offline provider
  are present in the registry

### Requirement: Online and offline providers are served on separate endpoints

The system SHALL serve online providers under `/online-payments` and offline
providers under `/offline-payments`. The path `/payment-gateways` SHALL NOT be
served.

Online payments SHALL support listing, listing installable providers,
installing a provider, reading one provider, updating one provider's settings,
and toggling one provider's enabled state. Offline payments SHALL support
listing, reading, creating, updating, deleting, and toggling one provider's
enabled state.

Toggling the enabled state of a provider, online or offline, SHALL accept only
the new `is_enabled` value and SHALL NOT require, or alter, any other field of
the provider.

An endpoint SHALL only return providers of its own kind: `/online-payments`
SHALL NOT return offline providers, and `/offline-payments` SHALL NOT return
online providers.

The system SHALL additionally serve a read-only combined listing at
`/payment-methods` that returns providers of both kinds. `/payment-methods`
SHALL support listing only; reading, creating, updating, deleting, enabling and
installing SHALL remain on the per-kind endpoints.

#### Scenario: Listing online providers

- **WHEN** a client requests `GET /online-payments`
- **THEN** the response contains only providers whose `is_offline` is `false`

#### Scenario: Listing offline providers

- **WHEN** a client requests `GET /offline-payments`
- **THEN** the response contains only providers whose `is_offline` is `true`

#### Scenario: Requesting an offline provider by id from the online endpoint

- **WHEN** a client requests `GET /online-payments/{id}` with the id of an
  offline provider
- **THEN** the request fails with a not-found response

#### Scenario: Retired paths are gone

- **WHEN** a client requests `GET /payment-gateways`
- **THEN** no route matches the request

#### Scenario: Listing all payment methods

- **WHEN** a client requests `GET /payment-methods`
- **THEN** the response contains every registered provider, both those whose
  `is_offline` is `false` and those whose `is_offline` is `true`
- **AND** each item includes `id`, `name`, `icon`, `icon_media`, `is_enabled`,
  `is_offline` and `description`

#### Scenario: Combined listing is read-only

- **WHEN** a client sends `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH` or `DELETE` to
  `/payment-methods`
- **THEN** no route matches the request

#### Scenario: Disabling an offline provider

- **WHEN** an administrator sends `PATCH /offline-payments/{id}` with
  `{ "is_enabled": false }` for an existing offline provider
- **THEN** the provider's `is_enabled` becomes `false`
- **AND** its name, icon, instructions and configuration are unchanged
- **AND** the response reports success

#### Scenario: Enabling an offline provider

- **WHEN** an administrator sends `PATCH /offline-payments/{id}` with
  `{ "is_enabled": true }` for an existing offline provider
- **THEN** the provider's `is_enabled` becomes `true`
- **AND** the provider is offered to shoppers at checkout

#### Scenario: Toggling an unknown offline provider

- **WHEN** an administrator sends `PATCH /offline-payments/{id}` with an id
  that matches no offline provider
- **THEN** the request fails with a not-found response and no provider changes

#### Scenario: Toggling an online provider id on the offline endpoint

- **WHEN** an administrator sends `PATCH /offline-payments/{id}` with the id of
  an online provider
- **THEN** the request fails with a not-found response

### Requirement: Provider webhooks are addressed by provider id

The system SHALL accept gateway callbacks at a webhook endpoint addressed by
the provider's id, and SHALL dispatch the callback to that provider.

#### Scenario: A gateway posts a webhook

- **WHEN** an external gateway posts to the payment webhook endpoint for the
  provider id `stripe`
- **THEN** the request is dispatched to the registered `stripe` provider

### Requirement: Offline providers are persisted under an offline-named key

The system SHALL persist the configured offline providers in the `payment`
settings option under the key `offline_payments`. The key `payment_gateways`
SHALL NOT be read or written.

Offline provider entries SHALL be written by, and readable through, both the
offline payments endpoints and the payment settings endpoint, using the same
field names in both.

Reading, creating, updating, deleting or toggling offline providers SHALL
behave correctly when the `offline_payments` list has never been saved: reads
and not-found lookups SHALL report no provider rather than failing, and
creating a provider SHALL start the list.

#### Scenario: Creating an offline provider

- **WHEN** a client creates an offline provider through `POST /offline-payments`
- **THEN** the new entry appears in the `offline_payments` list returned by
  `GET /settings/payment`

#### Scenario: Reading payment settings

- **WHEN** a client requests `GET /settings/payment`
- **THEN** the response body contains an `offline_payments` array
- **AND** it does not contain a `payment_gateways` key

#### Scenario: Data saved under the retired key

- **WHEN** the `payment` settings option contains only a legacy
  `payment_gateways` list and no `offline_payments` list
- **THEN** the store reports no configured offline providers, because the
  retired key is not read

#### Scenario: Offline providers were never configured

- **WHEN** the `payment` settings option has no `offline_payments` list and a
  client reads, updates, deletes or toggles an offline provider by id
- **THEN** the request fails with a not-found response rather than a server
  error

#### Scenario: Creating the first offline provider

- **WHEN** the `payment` settings option has no `offline_payments` list and a
  client creates an offline provider
- **THEN** the provider is saved and returned by `GET /offline-payments`

### Requirement: An order records the provider that took payment

The system SHALL record on each order the id of the payment provider used, in
a single field named `payment_provider`, and SHALL expose that field under the
same name in the order API. An order SHALL NOT carry a second, duplicate
provider field.

Any payment processing fee charged by the provider SHALL be recorded as
`invoiced_payment_provider_fee`.

#### Scenario: Placing an order

- **WHEN** an order is placed selecting a provider
- **THEN** the stored order's `payment_provider` is that provider's id
- **AND** the order carries no `payment_method` or `payment_gateway` field

#### Scenario: Refunding an order

- **WHEN** a refund is issued for an order
- **THEN** the provider named by the order's `payment_provider` is resolved
  from the registry and asked to process the refund

#### Scenario: Sorting orders by provider

- **WHEN** a client lists orders sorted by `payment_provider`
- **THEN** the request is accepted and the results are ordered by that field

### Requirement: Unavailable providers are listed as coming soon

The system SHALL report, for each installable online provider, whether it is
available to install (`is_available`) and whether it is already registered
(`is_installed`). A provider that is not yet available SHALL still be listed,
and the admin UI SHALL present it as forthcoming rather than offering to add
it.

#### Scenario: Listing installable providers

- **WHEN** a client requests the installable online providers
- **THEN** every known provider is listed, each reporting `is_available` and
  `is_installed`

#### Scenario: An unavailable provider in the admin UI

- **WHEN** the available-providers dialog renders a provider whose
  `is_available` is `false` and which is not installed
- **THEN** a "Coming Soon" indicator is shown in place of the add control

#### Scenario: An installed provider in the admin UI

- **WHEN** the available-providers dialog renders a provider whose
  `is_installed` is `true`
- **THEN** an "Added" indicator is shown in place of the add control

### Requirement: Checkout accepts only registered, enabled payment providers

The system SHALL validate the `payment_provider` submitted when an order is
placed. A `payment_provider` that matches no registered provider SHALL be
rejected with a validation error, and no order SHALL be created.

For an order placed by a shopper, a registered provider that is disabled SHALL
also be rejected, so that checkout accepts exactly the providers the storefront
offers. For an order created by an administrator on a customer's behalf (a
manual order), `payment_provider` remains optional and, when given, SHALL match
a registered provider; it is not required to be enabled.

#### Scenario: Shopper submits an unknown provider

- **WHEN** a shopper places an order with a `payment_provider` that matches no
  registered provider
- **THEN** the request fails with a validation error
- **AND** no order is created

#### Scenario: Shopper submits a disabled provider

- **WHEN** a shopper places an order with the id of a registered provider that
  is disabled
- **THEN** the request fails with a validation error
- **AND** no order is created

#### Scenario: Shopper submits an enabled provider

- **WHEN** a shopper places an order with the id of an enabled provider
- **THEN** the order is created with that provider recorded as its
  `payment_provider`

#### Scenario: Administrator creates a manual order without a provider

- **WHEN** an administrator creates a manual order with no `payment_provider`
- **THEN** the order is created

#### Scenario: Administrator creates a manual order with an unknown provider

- **WHEN** an administrator creates a manual order with a `payment_provider`
  that matches no registered provider
- **THEN** the request fails with a validation error

### Requirement: Provider settings are sanitized before they are saved

The system SHALL sanitize a provider's settings, using that provider's own
sanitization rules, before validating and persisting them, so that what is
stored is the sanitized value regardless of which endpoint saved it. Saving
partial settings SHALL remain allowed: sanitization SHALL NOT require any field
to be present.

#### Scenario: Saving settings with unsafe markup

- **WHEN** an administrator saves online provider settings in which a text
  field contains HTML tags
- **THEN** the stored value of that field has the tags removed

#### Scenario: Saving partial settings

- **WHEN** an administrator saves online provider settings containing only some
  of the provider's fields
- **THEN** the save succeeds and only the supplied fields are sanitized and
  stored
